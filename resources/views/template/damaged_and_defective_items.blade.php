                    <h3>Damaged and Defective Items</h3>
                    In the unlikely event that an item you ordered arrives damaged or is defective, you may return the item (and any other items from that order if they are part of a set) for a replacement or a full refund, as long as you report the issue within the following timeframes: <br />
                    1.	For Items Shipped by Parcel Carriers: <br >
                    Damaged and Defective Items: 15 days after delivery <br />
                    2.	For Items Shipped by Freight Carriers: <br />
                    1.	Damaged Items: 5 days after delivery. Itâ€™s critical to report the issue within that time period so that a claim can be filed with the carrier. <br  />
                    2.	Defective Items: 15 days after delivery. <br />
                    <p>
                            You can find the type of delivery (parcel or freight) for your item listed on your shipment confirmation email.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We encourage you to inspect the packaging of the item before you accept the item from the carrier. If the packaging or the item appears damaged when it arrives, you should take pictures of the damage and you may inform the carrier and refuse delivery. In that case, please report the issue within the applicable timeframe listed above and you can choose to receive a replacement or a refund.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                            To report an issue with an item, please visit the YOUR ORDER page, select the "Return or Replace Item" button for the order and follow the instructions. You may be required to submit photographs of the damaged or defective product and its packaging (the original packaging is required to facilitate a return unless it was damaged in transit and is unusable).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                            Important Note About Freight Forwarders: If you decide to use your own freight forwarder to ship an item or if you export an item outside the United States yourself or through another carrier, then UULOH will not be responsible for providing any replacement or refund for any damaged or defective items. You should not list UULOH on any export documentation.
