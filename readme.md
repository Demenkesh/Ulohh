# UULO App


## Introduction

Welcome to the **UULO App**! This application is designed to streamline the management of UULO-related processes. The system is built with Laravel, a robust PHP framework, and is designed to be easy to use, fast, and reliable.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following software installed on your system:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
- [PHP](https://www.php.net/) (PHP 8.0 or above)
- [Laravel](https://laravel.com/docs) (Laravel 8.x or above)
- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) or another compatible database
- [Artisan](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/artisan) CLI tool (bundled with Laravel)

## Installation

Follow these steps to clone and set up the project:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   Open your terminal and clone the repository with the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone {repository_url}
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   Navigate to the project directory and install the necessary dependencies using Composer:

   ```bash
   cd UULO-app
   composer update
   ```

3. **Configure Your Environment:**

   Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   Set up your database configuration in the `.env` file, including the database connection details.

4. **Generate the Application Key:**

   Run the following Artisan command to generate the application key:

   ```bash
   php artisan key:generate
   ```

5. **Run Database Migrations:**

   Now, migrate the database schema:

   ```bash
   php artisan migrate
   ```


6. ## Usage

Once everything is set up, you can start the Laravel development server using the following command:

```bash
php artisan serve
```

This will start the application on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`, where you can access it in your browser.

7. **Seed the Database:**

   To seed the database with initial data, run:

   ```bash
   http://127.0.0.1:8000/seed-database
   ```
