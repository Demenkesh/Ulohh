                <p>
                    When you shop on UULOH.COM, you can purchase products or services sold directly by UULOH or by third-party sellers who list their products or services for sale on our marketplace. In either case, our goal is to provide you with an outstanding customer experience every time you shop with us. This Return Policy covers all items purchased through uuloh.com. It's designed to give you confidence that we stand behind the products on our marketplace and to make returns easy if you're not fully satisfied with an item. You should review these terms carefully before making any purchase.

                    If you're not satisfied with an item that you purchased on UULOH, you can initiate a return within 15 days after delivery for a refund, if the item is in its original condition and packaging. Items that have been used or modified in any way may not be returned. Please see the next section if the item arrived damaged or defective; different terms may apply.
                    To return an item, visit the YOUR ORDER page, select the "Return or Replace Item" button for the appropriate order and follow the instructions. You will be responsible for the return shipping costs (even if you use a return shipping label provided by UULOH or the seller), except in instances where the item arrived damaged or defective. Note that the option to initiate a return will only appear for 15 days after delivery.
                    If you send the item back without the UULOH or the seller label, we recommend ensuring your return shipment is insured or using a trackable shipping method. Refunds will not be issued for items damaged in return transit or for returns that are never received.
                    Note that Items marked as final sale or "non-returnable" on the product page or during the checkout process, may not be returned.
                </p>

                    Refunds
                </h3>
                <p>
                    If you choose to get a refund for eligible items, you'll be refunded the purchase price and applicable sales tax. For damaged or defective items (and any other items from that order if they are part of a set), you will also receive a refund for any amount you may have paid through UULOH to have the item shipped to you. For items that were not damaged or defective, you will be responsible for the return shipping costs; if you use a return shipping label provided by UULOH or the seller.
                    Refunds will be issued to the original method of payment shortly after UULOH or the seller (as the case may be) receives and processes the eligible item. If we are unable to refund the original method of payment, UULOH will provide you with store credit for the refund due to you, which may only be used for purchases on UULOH.COM
