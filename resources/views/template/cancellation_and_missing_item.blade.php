                <p>
                    If your order is missing any items or parts, please notify us as soon as possible and no later than 15 days after delivery. If the item was sold by UULOH, you should contact UULOH Customer Support by clicking the "Contact UULOH" button on the YOUR ORDER page. If the item was sold by a third-party seller, you should contact the seller directly by clicking the "Contact Seller" button. That way, the right person can help you resolve the issues as quickly as possible.

                <h3>Cancellations</h3> 
                <p> 
                    You may cancel an order within 30 minutes after placing the order by visiting the YOUR ORDER page and selecting the "Cancel Order" button for the order. Note that the option to cancel will only appear for 30 minutes after you place an order. After that point, the order will be processed for delivery to you.
                    If you would like to cancel an order after 30 minutes, you should contact UULOH Customer Support by clicking the "Contact UULOH" button on the YOUR ORDER page, if the item was sold by UULOH, or click the "Contact Seller" button, if it was sold by a third-party seller. Please note that we cannot guarantee that your order can be canceled after 30 minutes, but we'll try our best to help.
